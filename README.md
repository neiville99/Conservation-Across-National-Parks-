# Conservation-Across-National-Parks-
This is for my Data Science and Machien Learning Traineeship. Investigating biodiverity across national parks by looking at the conservation status of various species.
Throughout this project I furtehr developed my data analyses and visulaition skills. I also had to clean and process the data for the project. There wasnt alot that 
needed to be done, but it was good to practice this aspect of data science, I've heard I'll be doing a lot more of it when I enter the industry.
