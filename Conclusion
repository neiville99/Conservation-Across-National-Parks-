The analysis of the conservation status distribution across various parks provides valuable insights into the state of biodiversity in these regions. 
By examining the total number of sightings and the relative percentages of species within different conservation statuses, several key observations 
can be made:

Prevalence of Conservation Status:
The data reveals that in all parks, over 97% of species fall under the "No Concern" category, which suggests that many species are relatively stable 
and not at immediate risk of extinction. This could be an indicator of healthy ecosystems in the parks. I also noticed that over the whole data set 
96.6% of the species fell under the no concern category. I think this is likely due to weighted averages as the range in total sightings for each 
park was 1,112,778.
Another notable insight is the number of species are categorised as "In Recovery", represented the lowest proportion at 0.09% of the data set. 
This indicates that species are not recovering once they enter endangered status. To mitigate this more effort must be spent on recovering already 
endangered species, or to find ways to prevent species numbers from falling into this category.

Park-Specific Insights:
Across all parks the data is relatively consistent. The biggest difference is the total number of sightings which, as mentioned earlier, has a range of 
1,112,778 but the distribution of converstaion status for each park never varies by more than 0.3%. Which shows cosistency among the diferent parks in how
they care for their animals. This suggests that  all of the parks in the data set will be complying to the same ules and guidelines. 

Species Observations:
Based on the analysis of the conservation status by category, Mammals emerge as the category most likely to be endangered, with 3.67% of species being 
classified as endangered or vulnerable. This suggests that mammal species may be more at risk compared to others. In contrast, amphibians (1.22%) and 
fish (2.29%) also show notable vulnerability, though at lower rates. The bird category (0.68%) and vascular plants (0.02%) display a relatively lower
proportion of endangered species. Interestingly, there are no data available for nonvascular plants and reptiles, which highlights a gap in conservation 
efforts or data collection for these categories. Overall, this analysis underscores the need for focused conservation strategies for mammals, fish, and 
amphibians, given their higher rates of endangerment.

Conclusions:
Based on the findings from the analysis of conservation status distribution across parks, the following recommendations are suggested to enhance 
conservation efforts and improve biodiversity management.
With only 0.09% of species in recovery, more resources should be allocated to help endangered species recover, and conservation for mammals, mmphibians, 
and Fish. Given their higher endangerment rates (mammals: 3.67%, amphibians: 1.22%, fish: 2.29%), conservation efforts should focus on protecting these 
groups through habitat protection and addressing threats like climate change. There is insufficient data for nonvascular plants and reptiles. More 
surveys and research should be conducted to assess their conservation status and needs. In doing so we may find that they require even more resources 
than even mammals.

In summary, targeted efforts to recover endangered species, focus on at-risk categories, and address data gaps will strengthen conservation across parks.
We can also take away that all parks, are following similar protocols and best practises to ensure development of healthy eco systems.
